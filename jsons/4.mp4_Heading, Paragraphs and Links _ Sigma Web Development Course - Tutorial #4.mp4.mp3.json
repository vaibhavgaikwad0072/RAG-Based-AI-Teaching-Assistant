  "text": " In today's video, I will tell you about the heading and paragraphs, and also about the anchor text. If you have liked this course, then do like this video. Your likes will help me in getting free courses. In this video, we will make a small project which will be a bookmark website. This bookmark website will help you in getting all your favorite websites in one place. You will be able to use it in actual use. So let's start quickly. Write down in the comments below, Sigma batch OP. Let's roll the intro. So guys, as you can see, I have already matched the screen. If you haven't yet accessed the playlist, then you can access it. One more thing I want to tell you is that if you go to github.com, you will get the Sigma web dev course github repo. I have made all the videos in this course in different folders. The committee is also made in different folders. You will get it. So you guys do access it so that you can get the source code. I will also put the link in the description. The video is in the course code. So there is no problem. Now we will make a very basic website today. But it will be very important for us because it will be our first useful website. So I will not take much time. I will make a new folder in the Sigma web dev folder. And I will name it video4 because it is our fourth video. So I will name it video4. I will shift right click and click open with code. So that this folder opens in our VS code. After doing this, I will do the same thing that we always do. Index.html, main.css, style.css and script.js. We usually make these three files. If I write CSS, I will write here. If I write script, I will write here. But for now, I will write some exclamation marks here and write in documents. My bookmarks. Okay, so we are going to make a bookmark website. I guess I will write code with diary here. So you guys must have seen these titles. Now I will write H1 here. What happens with H1? You can use H1 to add heading to your web page. We talked about basic structure. We said that this is HTML page. HTML lang is equal to en, and lang is an attribute. Its value is en. This page's content is in English. This tells search engines. Or if anyone is using web page link, then it will be known that this is web page in English. According to that, it can parse this web page. Browser will also be known that your web page is in English. Now here is the head in which metadata, title, page, CSS link is there. All these things are information. The main content is in the body. Now there is a tag to add heading in the body. Its name is H1. And I am going to write my bookmarks in it. So if I write my bookmarks here, then we will write this with H1 tags. And if I want to do it live here, I will click here and then I will open and browse it. So look at this, it shows my bookmarks as shown. Now why should we always use H1? Why didn't I write my bookmarks directly? Because I am telling the browser that this is my heading and this is my first level heading. Now suppose I want to keep two types of bookmarks in my bookmarks. One is the main bookmarks and one is secondary bookmarks. So I will use H2, that is the heading of the second level. So if you have used Microsoft Word, then you will know what H1 and H2 are. But if you don't know, then I will tell you that H1 is the heading of your main level. And the heading of the second level is from H2. Suppose I say main bookmarks and secondary bookmarks. Suppose I do something like this. And here I will press Alt, Shift and Down Arrow. I will work on the screencast mode. So what I did here, Alt, Shift and Down Arrow are replicated. This is the shortcut for VS Code. I would like to tell you another shortcut for VS Code. If you press Alt in your keyboard and wherever you click, it will become a cursor. Suppose I click outside, then there will be only one cursor. But by pressing Alt, if I click somewhere else, then there will be a cursor. So I want to make all the bookmarks with H1. So my bookmarks dash code with H1. I can write something like this. How did I do this? I clicked here, then pressed Alt. And wherever I click, I will get multiple cutters. Then whatever I type, they will come in multiple cutters. Wherever there are cutters, whatever I type, they will be visible. Isn't it fun? Like this. So I will remove this like this. And you will see that this will be updated. So this is my main heading. This is H2. Similarly, we have heading from H1 to H6. Suppose you gave the main heading. After the main heading, you gave a secondary heading. Then you had to give some heading inside it. And so on. You had to give a lot of subheadings. Then you can give heading to H6. H6 is more than enough. In HTML, you have given heading to H6. You will never need H7. If you talk in practical life. And if you read it, you can use H6 repeatedly. Because it becomes so small after H1. That H6 will become your very small. So it will not be so small. Now I will do Alt Shift Down Arrow. I will replicate it. And I will click Alt here. I will press Alt. I am telling you all these shortcuts. So that your productivity increases. Now I have put two cutters here and here. I will press backspace and H3. Then I will click here. I will press Alt here. I will click here. I will press H4. And I will click here. I will click here. I will press H5. After that I will click here. I will click here. I will press H6 here. So it is H6. Now what I will do? I will write here using H1. So that you will know. I will write using here. I will press space. I will write using. I will write H. And here I have left my work. Click here. Two, three, four, five and six. And you see it looks like this. So you will know that H1 is like this. H2 is like this. H3 is so small. H4 is so small. H5 is so small. H6 is so small. And H6 is so small. Then what will happen? It will be over in a while. So H6 is more than enough. So I will show you a practical demonstration. As you can see this is my HTML tutorial. So here I have given the main heading. HTML introduction. After that I have given the word as HTML. Then I have given the features of HTML. I have given this from H1. I have given this from H2. After that I have given something in H2. So I have given something from H3. There is something in it. Like here Y the term was hypertext and markup language. This is heading 2. What is the main heading page of HTML introduction? After that this is sub-adding. I had to give a quick exercise in it. I have used H3 in it. Then I have given H2 in it. Because it was in it. So H1 H3 H4 H5 H6 is used to build the hierarchy. Okay. I hope you have understood. Many people are commenting that you are starting very slowly. So we know. I am making this course as a beginner course. When I tell you about HTML. Then you will say yes. It is very easy. Then I will tell you a little bit of CSS. You will say yes. Then I will say JavaScript. You will say yes. Okay. Then I will say bootstrap. Yes. It will be done. It is a little difficult. Then I will say react. Then I will say what is happening. Then load the node. Okay. Then I will take the things. I will learn the things. Then after that I will say level. I said we will raise the bar like anything. This is what I meant. So when we will do the react. When I will make projects there. When we will do dangerous things. Then I will ask for their comments. Tell me what is the level. Okay. Don't talk about the level. The level is going to rise. By doing very good. So these are our headings. Our 6 headings. How I want to keep them like this. Now if we want to write a paragraph. You can use P tag. P enter. This paragraph will come. Now I will tell you a shortcut trick. If you want to bring dummy paragraph in the MET through VS code. What will you do? You will write here. Suppose I have written Lorem23. And here look. MET abbreviation has come. This is Lorem23. It will give me 23 words. Something like this. You can write a word with a view. You will not get a horizontal stroll bar. You can do a word wrap. Now look here. Lorem. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. $. Now I will click P Enter, if I click LOREM10, it will be 10 words. And if I click LOREM100, it will be filled up to my page, I can do that too. So this LOREM value trick is very good, you will enjoy it. And whenever we will make a clone from popular websites, I will make a clone from Amazon.in. I will make a clone from Amazon.in, so here I have to write something. Now I can't see text in the video, I have to write 3 words here. So I will write LOREM3, I will not think about makeup products. I will write LOREM4 or LOREM3, LOREM2. And I will make a template and then I will get everything that is in my database. And I can get it in text in a very different way. Many people asked me if this course is ready, the answer is yes. This course is going to be ready. Absolutely, I will make you all to be able to learn the actual industry level jobs through this course. Now let's talk about what attributes are in HTML. These are the attributes in HTML. Like I used the HTML tag, LANG is equal to LANG attribute. We didn't use any attribute in the body, we didn't use any attribute in H1. We didn't use any attribute in P, but I can use a style attribute in P. Which is called inline CSS, I will red the background color here. So the background color will be red, it is called inline CSS through style attribute. So if you add CSS to style, first we learned to add CSS here. But if you add style is equal to, you will get this background red. I will show you, you will get this red background. I will tilt this or this. Thistle, this color is looking good. So I can also add style inline. But when you make an industry level website, we use inline styles very less. Because the sustainability decreases, the reusability decreases. So we want to shift small bundles on the browser. And our website is more optimized. So we avoid all this. But inline CSS, style is a tag. But here style is an attribute, P is a tag. It is an attribute style of P tag, through which we can style this element. We will also learn about many other attributes. Attributes basically give an enhanced functionality to an element. For example, we gave this paragraph a style, which was background color. To give this background color, we used style attribute. Similarly, to give properties, we use an attribute to a tag or an element. Like if we talk about link, link colon CSS, link is relic attribute, href attribute. So what can we do with this attribute? We can apply this CSS style sheet. For example, background color, I say body first. What we want in body, background color. And don't worry about it. Don't worry about how it is going to be done. Because CSS will tell you everything. But I am telling you that I am doing hot pink. Listen to another functionality of VS Code. This ninja technique is very useful. Over here mouse. And here you can choose the color you want. I will leave it like this. And you see here, the background color of my body is like this. How did you like it? Ninja Technique is very good. Now we are back in index.html. I can remove it if I want. I will comment it, so this style sheet will not be left. Which is very natural. The background color was coming from this style sheet. It is gone. This background color was coming from inline CSS. So it is not gone. Which is very natural. It is very normal. Here I did this style is equal to background color. Because of which it was looking like background color. Now we are going to make a bookmark manager. BookmarkManager.html I am making it for a different file. Because here I have told you different headings. I am going to make a useful bookmark manager. I will write here. BookmarkManager.html Now you may ask why are you making this bookmark manager in Chrome? This is made by our hands. This will be our own child. We have made it. So you will have a different value for it. Because you made this yourself. Someone made a software. You bought it from somewhere. You made a software yourself. So the software you made yourself is different. Now you can see here. BookmarkManager.html I will write here H1 and my bookmarks. I will write my bookmarks. Now I will write H2 here. Primary bookmarks. And after that I will write here. H2 is secondary bookmarks. In fact, if I do all shift bottom. And I write here secondary bookmarks. So what will happen? Here I can write secondary bookmarks. Now what I will do? I will write in a paragraph. Google. Or I will write like this. We will write it from the list. But in the coming videos. I will tell you how to use the list. For now you can understand. Google. Suppose I write it here. Open Google. And what will I do here? I will use anchor tag. So I will enter like A in A. One mandatory attribute is HREF. HREF means that click it and go to which link. So I will write HREF is equal to. HTTPS colon double slash www.google.com. It will go to this address. Whenever you click on open google. And I will put this open google here. The content of this tag will be like this. And here you can see. A HREF is equal to A or open google. It is called anchor tag. Which helps us to make links. You must have seen many such links. Now you see here. As soon as I go to bookmarkmanager.html. You can see here. You can see all the bookmarks. Open google. Now I will click on it. Google will open. You can see. You noticed that when I did not click on it. It was blue. Now I have visited it. So its color changed. So its color changes when you visit it. That is, it has been converted into a visited link. So I am aware that I have visited it. Now I will tell you one more thing. If we want to open this new tab. As I am clicking on it. It is opening in the same tab. If you want to open it in the new tab. You have two ways. Either you can click on this wheel of your mouse. This mouse wheel. You can click on it. I will tell you another way. If you want to open a new tab. You can use an attribute. You can write here. Target is equal to underscore blank. And VS Code gives you suggestions. So I wrote it by entering two. It is written in notepad. It is written in any other cheap editor. So what would have happened to you? It is cheap according to the quality. Free VS Code is also there. But if you use a cheap editor according to the quality. So target is equal to underscore blank. You have to type it. It gets a little pain. But if you write it in any way. Now I will click on it. I am clicking. I am not clicking on the mouse wheel. I am clicking. I will click on the new tab. I will click on the mouse wheel. It will open in the new tab. So I can open it like this. Now I have written a very simple open google. If you want. You can use your favorite website. You can use any website you like. You have put good websites here. Friends. Now I will write here. Open Facebook. And here you see. Facebook.com. And I write here. Kora.com. And CodeWitherry.com. And here we put. Let us see. Which website should I put. YouTube.com. Let's see if it came here or not. You have seen one thing. It is coming in the same line. If you want it not to come in the same line. So what will you do now? You will put it in your own paragraph. This is a very dirty way. I am calling it dirty way. I will tell you this later. But you close it in a paragraph. If you want. And I will press shift. I will press the right arrow. I will press control X. Then after that I will press the end. I will press the end. I will press the end. I will press the end. I will press the end. I will press the end. I will press the end. I will press the shift. I will press the right arrow. I will press control X. Then after that I will press the end. All the cursors will go to the end. Because if there is a cursor on the end. Then they go to the end. And after that I will press control. Now I have used this very shortcut. And many of you will be like this. What did you do? If you start. But I simply used the functionality of VS code. The functionality of multiple cursor. I pressed all and brought multiple cursor. And after that I used it. This is not a good way to use the paragraphs. We don't make any list. We make it using the list. But because we have not read the list. So we are using the paragraph. But this will do our work. This will look like this. And the ones we have not visited. Look, they are blue. We visited Facebook. Its color has also been purple. We visited Kora. Its color has also been purple. So now this is your primary bookmarks. What are your secondary bookmarks? We will put two secondary bookmarks. Secondary bookmarks are yours. Which you visit sometimes. Take a look at Wikipedia.com. Wikipedia.com has come here. And take a look at Stackoverflow.com. We will write the spelling correctly. Stackoverflow.com. Stackoverflow.com. We will capitalize it. And now look at the secondary bookmarks. Wikipedia and Stackoverflow.com. So this is your bookmark manager. And you can make this bookmark manager even better. We will learn CSS and styling. So if you see this as the next one. Don't worry. Don't say that this is a very bad next one. Don't worry at all. Because we will do styling and designing in the coming time. We will talk about all those things. For now your bookmark looks like this. The bookmark manager is your title. And I will write it in H1. So both will be same. Our title and H1. That means our title will be same. And my bookmarks code will also be written here. So in this way you can make a bookmark manager. You can actually use it. Now if you save it like this. Like my bookmark manager is at html. You can copy it and put it on your desktop. Whenever you want to open a website. You can just double click it. If you double click it and open it from VS code. Then what you have to do. Right click it. Open with it. Choose another app. And then you have to choose Google Chrome. Always do it. So like I will choose Google Chrome. And I will always do it. So whenever I will double click it. Google Chrome will open it. So this was our bookmark manager. I hope you liked it. Now I have a request from you. Our 4 videos are completed today.
